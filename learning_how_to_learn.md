Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes
- Focused mode - a neural pattern that arises when focus is placed squarely on what is to be assimilated or solved. Think of this mode as a pinball machine with obstacles very tightly grouped so that when the ball stikes an obstacle, it travels a short distance before encountering another one. In fact, it is entirely possible that after significant repetition, certain patterns of thinking arise and become the default ways in which similar thoughts are processed in the future.
- Diffuse mode - a neural pattern that arises when focus is not directed toward a singular entity. Rather, thinking is more relaxed and assumes a big-picture perspective. Think of this mode as a pinball machine with obstacles spread out widely. The ball will often travel for long distances before striking another obstacle. This mode of thinking is crucial for making new neural connections traveling along new pathways.

Using Focused and Diffuse Modes
- When grappling with something difficult, your brain should be allowed to go back and forth between focused and diffuse modes.
- Metaphors provide powerful techniques for learning.
- Learning something difficult takes time. Akin to building strength which requires lifting weights regularly, learning requires application of oneself regularly so that the underlying neural connections are built.
- Dr. Oakley cites examples of how Dali and Edison purposefully enter diffuse modes and force themselves out of that mode right before falling asleep before resuming focused work.

What is learning?
- Sleep knits up the loose threads of experience from the day and makes a tight-knit tapestry.
- During a learning event, the dendrites of neurons involved in the neural pathway form many new synapses with other dendrites from neighboring neurons. These synapses become fortified after sleep!
- There an estimated million billion synapses in the brain!

Procrastination
- The insular cortex (brain region associated with pain) is activated when you identify things you don't want to work on.
- Studies have shown that after engaging in the once unpleasant task, the sense of pain/anxiety that precedes procrastination dissipates.
- Procrastination is essentially: an unhappy feeling about some difficult task -> to reduce unhappiness, funneling attention onto a more pleasant task -> feeling happy (temporarily)
- The Pomodoro technique is a good way to battle procrastination in that the technique allows for short-term bursts of focused effort followed by a small reward.

Practice makes permanent
- It is important to practice topics like math and science because they are inherently abstract relative to things like identifying physical objects or emotions.
- Through practice, the neural patterns underlying abstract concepts become fortified and permanence is achieved.
- When you learn, study something hard by focusing intently. Then take a break and relax by doing something else allowing your diffuse mode to take over.
- Taking a break allows your neural 'mortar' to dry thereby helping build strong neural structures.
- Recall that you can outwit procrastination by using the pomodoro technique.
